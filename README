A set of files to play the board game Othello (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reversi). Most of the files were 
written by my 11th grade AP CS teacher, but all of the files with "*Player" were written by me. StackPlayer.java,
in particular, uses Minimax and Alpha-Beta Pruning to look 6 moves ahead in under a second.
